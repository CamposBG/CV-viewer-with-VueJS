<img src="./picture-for-github/vue_project.gif">

## Description

- As my first vue project, I created a resume viewer page (this is just the basic front end app);

- By clicking on the cards (left section), it shows detailed information on the right section;

- All information is dynamically populated using VueJS from an object (simulating a JSON that came from an API);


### Technologies applied:

- HTML
- CSS
- VueJS (version 2x)

---
### What I Learned:
- The Vue Instance;
- Template Syntax;
- Watchers;
- Vue derivatives v-on and  v-bind;
- Mapping an Array of Objexts to Elements with v-for.

---

## How To Use

- Clone the repository and open the index.html on a browser.
